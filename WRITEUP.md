# Project: Estimation

# [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1807/view) Points
Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

## Writeup / README

### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.

You're reading it! Below I describe how I addressed each rubric point and where in my code each point is handled.

## Implement Estimator

### 1. Determine the standard deviation of the measurement noise of both GPS X data and Accelerometer X data.


### 2. Implement a better rate gyro attitude integration scheme in the `UpdateFromIMU()` function.


### 3. Implement all of the elements of the prediction step for the estimator.


### 4. Implement the magnetometer update.


### 5. Implement the GPS update.


## Flight Evaluation

### 1. Meet the performance criteria of each step.

### 2. De-tune your controller to successfully fly the final desired box trajectory with your estimator and realistic sensors.
